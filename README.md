# typescript-node-starter
Starter template for TypeScript for NodeJS with VS Code

When running (or debugging) in Visual Studio Code the build task will automatically calle the compile-script and compile all TypeScript files.

The build script is based on that of a VS Code extensions project for TypeScript.
